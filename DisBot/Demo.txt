Get up! Get up!

The winner, by total annihilation...

Yama!

Who is next?

Who has the guts to step into

the ring with little yama?

Yama!

Can I try?

I have a robot. I built it myself.

Beat it, kid.

House rules. You gotta pay to play.

Is this enough?

What's your name, little boy?

Hiro. Hiro hamada.

Prepare your bot, zero.

Two bots enter,

one bot leaves.

Fighters ready?

Fight!

That was my first fight.

I... can I try again?

No one likes a sore loser, little boy.

Go home.

I've got more money.

Fighters ready?

Fight!

Mega-bot, destroy.

What?

-No more little yama.

-But, wha...

This is not possible!

Hey, I'm as surprised as you are.

Beginner's luck.

Do you want to go again, yama?

-No one hustles yama!

-Whoa. Hey...

Teach him a lesson.

Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this.

-Hiro! Get on!

-Tadashi!

Good timing!

Oh, mama!

-Are you okay?

-Yeah.

-Are you hurt?

-No.

Then what were you thinking,

knucklehead?

You graduated high school

when you were 13,

and this is what you're doing?

There they are!

Hey!

Hold on!

Yes!

Get back here.

Bot fighting is illegal.

You're going to get yourself arrested.

Bot fighting is not illegal.

Betting on bot fighting,

that's... that's illegal.

But so lucrative!

I'm on a roll, big brother!

And there is no stopping me!

Oh, no.

Hi, aunt cass.

Are you guys okay?

Tell me you're okay.

-We're fine.

-We're okay.

Oh, good.

Then what were you

two knuckleheads thinking?

For 10 years,

I have done the best I could

to raise you.

Have I been perfect? No.

Do I know anything about children? No.

Should I have picked up a book

on parenting?

Probably!

Where was I going with this?

I had a point.

-Sorry.

-We love you, aunt cass.

Well, I love you, too!

I had to close up early

because of you two felons.

On beat poetry night.

Stress eating. Because of you.

Come on, mochi.

This is really good!

You better make this up to aunt cass

before she eats everything in the cafe.

For sure.

And I hope you learned

your lesson, bonehead.

Absolutely.

You're going bot fighting, aren't you?

There's a fight across town.

If I book, I can still make it.

When are you gonna

start doing something

with that big brain of yours?

What? Go to college like you?

So people can tell me stuff

I already know?

Unbelievable.

What would mom and dad say?

I don't know.

They're gone.

They died when I was three, remember?

Hey!

-I'll take you.

-Really?

I can't stop you from going,

but I'm not going

to let you go on your own.

Sweet.

What are we doing at your nerd school?

Bot-fight's that way!

Gotta grab something.

Is this gonna take long?

Relax, you big baby.

We'll be in and out.

Anyway, you've never seen my lab.

Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab!

Heads up!

Electro-mag suspension?

Hey!

-Who are you?

-I'm...

Go go, this is my brother Hiro.

Welcome to the nerd lab.

Yeah.

I've never seen electro-mag

suspension on a bike before.

Zero resistance, faster bike.

But, not fast enough...

...yet.

Do not move. Behind the line, please.

Hey, wasabi. This is my brother Hiro.

Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed.

Catch.

Wow.

-Laser-induced plasma?

-Oh, yeah.

With a little magnetic confinement

for ultra-precision.

Wow. How do you find anything

in this mess?

I have a system.

There's a place for everything,

and everything in its place.

-Need this!

-You can't do that!

This is anarchy! Society has rules!

Excuse me!

Coming through!

Tadashi!

Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro!

I've heard so much about you!

Perfect timing. Perfect timing.

That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide.
